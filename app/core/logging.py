"""
Logging configuration module for the ChatGPT Team Relay.

This bridges the core config with the utility logger. The main entrypoint,
`configure_logging(settings)`, ensures that the global logger is set up
exactly once using the environment-driven values (LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT, etc.)
defined in :mod:`app.utils.logger`. It accepts a ``settings`` instance but does
not mutate or rely on it; the presence of ``settings`` in the signature
satisfies FastAPI/uvicorn calling conventions.

Consumers should import and call :func:`configure_logging` at application
startup to ensure consistent logging::

    from app.core.logging import configure_logging

    configure_logging(settings)

This design keeps logging configuration centralised while allowing easy
extension in the future.

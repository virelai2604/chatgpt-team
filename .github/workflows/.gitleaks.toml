# Gitleaks configuration
# - Uses the default ruleset
# - Adds an allowlist for known placeholder strings in docs/examples
#
# Config precedence notes (CLI + action):
# - You can set --config, or GITLEAKS_CONFIG, or place a .gitleaks.toml at repo root.
# - This file is explicitly referenced in the workflow via GITLEAKS_CONFIG.
#
# Keep allowlists narrow: exclude only intentional placeholders, not real secrets.
